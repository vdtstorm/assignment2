YOu can use branches to safely manage workflow and separate processes
You also use branches to prevent merging and changes

(E)
git log shows when a file was commited and git status shows when a file was modified

I would use the command "git log vehicle.h" to see where any commits related to Vehicle.h is involved.

You would use the command git log --grep=“file“

Inheritance is the capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class.
Polymorphism is hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.
Encapsulation is the process of combining data members and functions in a single unit called class.


(I)
In integration workflow each developer makes push to their own public repository, 
and pull from the blessed/central repository
In the Director and lieutenants workflow Everyone makes pull from the blessed/central repository and 
only the dictator can push to it.
With integration each developer has control, but with director and lieutenants one 
person has the control.


(J)
With centralized workflow developers have to make their own changes with no review by anyone, but 
if there were 100 developers they would benefit fromthe dictator and lieutenants work flow so there file will be reviewed by the lieutenants and accepted by the dictator.
